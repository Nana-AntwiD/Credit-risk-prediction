# Credit Risk Prediction for Microfinance

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict loan default risk for microfinance applications, with a focus on promoting financial inclusion in emerging markets.

## Business Context
Access to credit is a major barrier for small businesses and individuals in developing economies. Traditional credit scoring models often fail to serve this population due to lack of formal credit history. This project explores how machine learning can leverage alternative data to assess creditworthiness more inclusively.

## Objectives
- Build a predictive model for loan default probability
- Identify key risk factors
- Create an interpretable scoring system
- Minimize false negatives (rejecting creditworthy applicants)
- Ensure model fairness across demographic groups

## Dataset
[To be added: source, size, features]

## Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Development (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network)
4. Model Evaluation and Comparison
5. Interpretability Analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10+
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost
- matplotlib, seaborn
- SHAP for model interpretation

## Results
[To be added after analysis]
